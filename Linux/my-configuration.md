# My workstation configuration

# Which model you choosed ?

Before naming the model, I would like to say first that I set some limits regarding the budget and the performance of the machine. I need a lpatop for the school and events and I want it to be as powerful as possible (I thinked about an i7 or Ryzen 7 and 16GB, seems good for few virtual machines and pentesting) for a budget around $600 (550‚Ç¨). So, I looked for a second hand computer on famous marketplaces in order to get a good bank for the but. Ideally I would like a fingerprint sensor and a lightweight one (for mooving).

As an IT worker for few years now, I noticed that a lot of enterprises (including the ones I was in) switched from various brands to Lenovo Thinkpads for good reasons as look, feel, performance/price, keyboard, functionalities and most of all stability and good support. I had many Thinkpads in hands and feel great. I will take one personnally.

The context is said, after few weeks of search I found one feets my needs in a perfect condition. The storage was about 500GB, so I commanded a new nvme of 1TB at the same time.

Here is the precise model i have now :

All specifications could be found [here](https://www.officexpress.fr/10145925-20y1000qfr-lenovo-thinkpad-p14s-gen-20y1-amd-ryzen-pro-4750u-jusqu-ghz-win-pro-bits-radeon-graphics-ram-256-ssd-tcg-opal-encryption-ips-1920-1080-full-noir-clavier-fran-ais-3540260184357)

**PS** : I thinked about thinkpad with IntelME disabled and libreboot üïµÔ∏è, but minifree.org don't provide recent machines, it is a T440p (a brick) and there is a significant gap betwteen the i7 4th gen and the Ryzen 7 4th gen.
